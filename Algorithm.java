Key Components:
Routine Checkup Process: This involves checking if the user's Aadhar is still active or has been deactivated. This check could be performed at regular intervals.
Auto-Forwarding Messages: If the user's Aadhar credentials are deactivated, the system will automatically forward the user's saved last messages to the respective recipients.

User Registration:
Collect user details and messages.
Save them into the database.

Routine Checkup:
The system will perform routine checks to see if the user's Aadhar credentials are deactivated (this can be done at set intervals, e.g., daily, using a scheduler).
If the Aadhar credentials are deactivated, it triggers the forwarding process.

Forwarding Messages:
If the user is dead (i.e., Aadhar is deactivated), retrieve the saved messages.
Automatically forward these messages to the intended recipients via email, SMS, or another messaging service.



Java Algorithm for Routine Checkup and Auto-Forwarding Messages
Below is a high-level Java algorithm that implements this functionality:


import java.util.List;

public class RoutineCheckupAndMessageForwarding {

    // Step 1: Define classes for User, Aadhar, Message, Recipient (simplified)
    class User {
        String userID;
        Aadhar aadhar;
        List<Message> messages;
        
        public User(String userID, Aadhar aadhar, List<Message> messages) {
            this.userID = userID;
            this.aadhar = aadhar;
            this.messages = messages;
        }

        // Method to check if the user is dead (Aadhar deactivated)
        public boolean isDead() {
            return this.aadhar.isDeactivated();
        }
    }

    class Aadhar {
        String aadharNumber;
        boolean isDeactivated;

        public Aadhar(String aadharNumber) {
            this.aadharNumber = aadharNumber;
            this.isDeactivated = false; // assume it's active initially
        }

        public void deactivate() {
            this.isDeactivated = true; // deactivate the Aadhar
        }

        public boolean isDeactivated() {
            return this.isDeactivated;
        }
    }

    class Message {
        String content;
        Recipient recipient;

        public Message(String content, Recipient recipient) {
            this.content = content;
            this.recipient = recipient;
        }
    }

    class Recipient {
        String name;
        String contactInfo;

        public Recipient(String name, String contactInfo) {
            this.name = name;
            this.contactInfo = contactInfo;
        }

        // Method to forward the message to the recipient (via email, SMS, etc.)
        public void receiveMessage(String messageContent) {
            System.out.println("Message for " + name + ": " + messageContent);
            // Simulate message sending (e.g., sending email/SMS)
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Routine checkup method (to be run periodically)
    public void performRoutineCheckup(List<User> users) {
        for (User user : users) {
            if (user.isDead()) {
                forwardMessagesToRecipients(user);
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Forward the messages to the recipients
    private void forwardMessagesToRecipients(User user) {
        System.out.println("Forwarding messages for user " + user.userID);
        for (Message message : user.messages) {
            message.recipient.receiveMessage(message.content);
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Simulating the process
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 4.1: Setup Users, Aadhar, and Messages
        RoutineCheckupAndMessageForwarding system = new RoutineCheckupAndMessageForwarding();
        Aadhar aadhar1 = system.new Aadhar("1234-5678-9012");
        Recipient recipient1 = system.new Recipient("Jane", "jane@example.com");
        Message message1 = system.new Message("Goodbye, Jane. Take care.", recipient1);
        User user1 = system.new User("user123", aadhar1, List.of(message1));

        // Step 4.2: Simulate user death by deactivating Aadhar
        aadhar1.deactivate();  // User dies

        // Step 4.3: Perform routine checkup
        system.performRoutineCheckup(List.of(user1));  // Routine checkup on users
    }
}




///Breakdown of the Algorithm:

User, Aadhar, Message, and Recipient Classes:
The User class contains basic user information and their Aadhar credentials. It has a method isDead() that checks if the Aadhar credentials have been deactivated.
The Aadhar class holds information about the Aadhar number and whether it is deactivated or not.
The Message class represents a message that is saved by the user to be sent to a recipient after their death.
The Recipient class represents the individual who will receive the message. It contains a receiveMessage() method which simulates the process of forwarding a message (this can be enhanced to actually send emails/SMS).

Routine Checkup:
The performRoutineCheckup() method checks for each user if their Aadhar has been deactivated. If it has, it calls forwardMessagesToRecipients() to send the saved messages to the recipients.

Auto-Forwarding Messages:
The forwardMessagesToRecipients() method goes through all the saved messages for the user and forwards them to each recipient by calling the 
receiveMessage() method on each recipient object.

Simulating User Death:
In the main() method, the aadhar1.deactivate() line simulates the userâ€™s death by deactivating their Aadhar credentials.
After deactivating the Aadhar, the system performs the routine checkup by calling performRoutineCheckup() and automatically forwards any saved messages to the designated recipients.
